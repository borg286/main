# This file is our "App-of-apps". It is initially pushed into k8s by the terraform_bootstrap/m2-k8s-apps
# Then argocd fetches the main git repo, goes into the apps folder to find the kustomize.yaml
# which globs this self-same file.
# We avoid a circular dependency because argocd does an apply to k8s, so this should match
# the version pushed by terraform and thus not trigger a reconsiliation cycle in argo.
